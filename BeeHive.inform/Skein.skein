The tree provides a wonderous shade during the summer months that you take advantage of whenever you can.  However, now as fall is in full swing and winter is approaching, the leaves are beginning to fall and pile up under the tree.  The leaves are becoming sparse in the tree and you can see a hornet's nest about ten feet up on a branch.  To the south is your ancient utility shed where you store all the essentials.  You can go west to get on your porch. &#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a shade tree here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

The tree provides a wonderous shade during the summer months that you take advantage of whenever you can.  However, now as fall is in full swing and winter is approaching, the leaves are beginning to fall and pile up under the tree.  The leaves are becoming sparse in the tree and you can see a hornet's nest about ten feet up on a branch.  To the south is your ancient utility shed where you store all the essentials.  You can go west to get on your porch. &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[9] lean ladder on tree&#x000A;You lean the ladder against the tree, being careful not to bump the nest in the process.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] u&#x000A;&#x000A;Up the Tree&#x000A;You are standing near the top of the ladder near the nest.

You'll have these doggone hornets out of your hair in no time.

You jump out of the tree and run around screaming wildely.  For a few moments you don't even realize that after the hornets got you out of the tree, they went back to their nest.&#x000A;&#x000A;Well that didn't work too well.  You throw the can away in disgust and as it bounces off  it hits square on the nozzle, which promptly breaks off and a long spray comes out until now the can is now truly empty.

The tree provides a wonderous shade that you take advantage of whenever you can.  However, there seems to be a hornet's nest that is disrupting your relaxation.  To the south is your ancient utility shed where you store all the essentials.  You can go west to get on your porch. &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[7] lean ladder on tree&#x000A;You lean the ladder against the tree, being careful not to bump the nest in the process.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[8] u&#x000A;&#x000A;Up the Tree&#x000A;You are standing near the top of the ladder near the nest.

You'll have these doggone hornets out of your air in no time.  You shake the can one last time, more of a nervous habit than out of necessity, take careful aim.....&#x000A;&#x000A;...You shake the can and look at it in horror.  Just a little spray dribbled out of the can....just enough to grab the hornets attention.  They have noticed you and are headed in your direction.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;[10] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;The hornets swarm around you aggressively, diving in and trying to penetrate through the wall of your flailing arms .  You jump out of the tree and run around screaming wildely.  For a few moments you don't even realize that after the hornets got you out of the tree, they went back to their nest.&#x000A;&#x000A;Hiding outside the Shed&#x000A;Your utility shed was built back in the 1860s and is falling down, however it's close to the house, easy to get to and large enough to store just about anything you need around the yard.  &#x000A;&#x000A;Well that didn't work too well.  You throw the can away in disgust and as it bounces off  it hits square on the nozzle, which promptly breaks off and a long spray comes out until now the can is now truly empty.  As you look on in disbelief, a thought comes to you; hornets don't like smoke, why don't I try smoking them out.&#x000A;&gt;[11] z&#x000A;Time passes.&#x000A;&#x000A;From here you can hear the angry buzz of the hornets.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
