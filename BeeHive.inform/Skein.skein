There is a dirty window in the north wall that looks back towards your front yard and a shelf covered in junk just inside the doorway to the north.  &#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a can of now empty bug killer here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">Outside the Shed&#x000A;Your utility shed was built back in the 1860s and is falling down.  However it's close to the house, easy to get to and large enough to store just about anything you need around the yard.  Your large tree is to the north and to the northwest is the front porch of your house.  Stacked to one side of the shed is a woodpile. &#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">Under the Tree&#x000A;You are standing under the large shade tree in the front yard.  The tree provides wonderous shade during the summer months that you take advantage of whenever you can.  However, now as fall is in full swing and winter is approaching, the leaves are beginning to fall and pile up under the tree.  The leaves are becoming sparse in the tree and you can see a hornet's nest about ten feet up on a branch.  To the south is your ancient utility shed where you store all the essentials.  You can go west to get on your porch.  Your ladder is leaning up against the tree and  thebranch you just cut is laying on the ground.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a small pile of flaming twigs here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">The can sits in the fire for a few moments and then it starts to turn a hot red as it heats up.  As the sides of the can start to bulge out at the center you quickly decide it's time to hide behind the tree.  Just as you retreat behind the tree you hear a large explosion and you hit the ground.  You hear a whistle as the exploded can flys towards the nest hitting it right in the bottom, plugging up the entrance to the nest.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;    *** Here ends the intro to Hornet's Nest.  I hope you enjoyed this introduction to this piece.  I plan to add more ways to try and achieve your goal of removing the nest from the tree.   ***&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;In that game you scored 0 out of a possible 0, in 45 turns.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT or UNDO the last command?&#x000A;&gt;</result>
